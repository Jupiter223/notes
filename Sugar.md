waffle cones piled high with icecream

are you craving desert?

sugar is a general term used to describe a class of molecules



Picture warm gooey cookies,crunchy candies,velvety cakes,waffle cones piled high with ice cream.Is your mouth watering?Are you craving dessert?Why?What happens in the brain that makes sugary foods so hard to resist?Sugar is a general term used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates and it's found in a wide variety in food and drink.Just check the labels on sweet products you buy.Glucose,fructose,sucrose,maltose,lactose,dextrose and starch are forms of sugar.So are high fructose corn syrup,fruit juice,raw sugar and honey.And sugar isn't just in candies and desserts.It's also added to tomato source,yougurt,dried fruit,flavored waters or granola bars.Since sugar is everywhere,it's important to understand how it effects the brain.What happens when sugar hits your tongue?And does eating a little bit of sugar make you crave more?You take a bite of cereal.The sugars it contains activate the sweet-taste receptors,part of the taste buds on the tongue.These receptors send signal up to the brain stem. And from there, it forks off into many areas of the forebrain,one of which is the cerebral cortex.

Different sections of the cerebral cortex process different tastes:bitter salty umami and in our case sweet.From here, the signal activates the brain's reward system.This reward system is a series of electrical and chemical pathways across several regions of the brain.It's a complicated network.It helps answer a single subconsious question:should I do that again?That warm fuzzy feeling you get when you taste your grandma's chocolate cake?That's your reward system saying,umm yes.And it's not just activated by food,socializing,sexual behavior and drugs,are just a few examples that things and experiences that also activate the reward system.But overactivating this reward system kickstarts a series of unfortunate events:lost of control,craving,and increased tolerance to sugar.

Let's get back to our bite of cereal.It travels down into your  stomach and eventually into your gut.And guess what ,there are sugar receptors here,too.They are not taste buds.But they do send signals telling your brain that you are full or that your body should produce more insulin to deal with the extra sugar you're eating.The major currency of our reward system is dopamine, an important chemical and neurotransmitter.They are many dopamine receptors in the forebrain,but they are not evenly distributed.Certain areas contain dense of clusters of dopamine receptors,and these dopamine hot spots are a part of our reward system.Drugs like alcohol, nicotine or heroin send dopamine into overdrive,leading some people to constantly seek that high.In other words ,to be addicted.Sugar also cause dopamine to be released,though not as violently as drugs.And sugar is rare among dopamine-inducing foods.Broccoli,for example, has no effect.It's probably explain why it's so hard to get kids to eat their veggies.Speaking of healthy foods,let's say you're hungry and decide to eat a balanced meal.You do,and dopamine levels spike in the reward system hot spots.But if you eat that same dish many days in a row, dopamine levels will spike less and less,eventually leveling out.That's because when it comes to food,the brain involved to pay special attention to new or different tastes.

Why？

Two reasons:First,to detect food that's gone bad.And second,beacause the more variety we have in our diet,the more likely we are to get all the nutrients we need.To keep that variety up, we need to be able to recognice a new food and more important ,we need to want to keep eating new foods.And that's why the dopamine levels off when a food becomes boring.Now  back to that meal,what happens if in place the healthy balanced dish, you eat sugar rich food instead.If you rarely eat sugar,or don't eat much in a time,the effect is similar to that balanced meal.But if you eat too much, the dopamine response  does not level out.In other words, eating lots of sugar will continue to feel rewarding.In this way,sugar behaves a little bit like a drug.It's one reason people seem to be hooked on sugary foods.So think back to all those different kinds of sugar.Each one is unique,but every time any sugar is consumed.It kickstarts a domino effect in the brain that sparks a rewarding feeling.Too much too often,and things can go into overdrive.so yes, overconsumption of sugar can have addictive effects on the brain. but a wedge of cake once in a while won't hurt you.

Over one hundred thousand metric tons of caffeine are consumed around  the world every year.That's equivalent to the weight of 14 Eiffel Towers.Most of this caffeine is consumed in coffee and tea,but it's also ingested in some sodas,chocolate,caffeine pills,and even beverages labled decaf.Caffeine helps us fell alert,focused,happy,and energetic.Even we haven't had enough sleep.But it can also raise our blood pressure,and make us feel anxious.It's the world most widely used drug.So how does it keep us awake?Caffeine evolved in plants where it serves a few purposes.In high doses,as it's found in the leaves and seeds of certain species.It‘s toxic to insects.But when they consume it in lower doses,as it's found in nectar.It can actually help them remember and revisit flowers.

In the human body,caffeine acts as a stimulant for the central nervous system.It keeps us awake by blocking one of the body's key sleep-inducing molecules,a substance called adenosine.Your body needs a constant supply of energy,which it gets by breaking down a high-energy molecules called ATP.

In the process,it liberates adenosine,ATP's chemical backbone.Neurons in your brain have receptors perfectly tailored to this molecule.When adenosine docks to these receptors,it activates a cascade of biochemical  reactions that couse neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important brain-signaling molecules.In other words you get sleepy.Caffeine is what's called an adenosine receptor antagonist.That means it derails this process of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors.

Caffeine and Adenosine have a similiar molecular structure,close enough that caffeine can wedge into the adenosine receptors,but not close enough to activate them.To summarize, adenosine inhibits your nuerons.Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,so it stimulates you.Caffeine can also boost positive feelings.In some neurons,the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors for another molecule called dopamine.One of dopamine's roles in the brain is to promote feelings of pleasure.

When adenosine docks in one of these paried receptors,that can make it harder for dopamine to fit in its own spot,interrupting its mood-lifting work.But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,it doesn't have the same effect,and dopamine can slide in.There's evidence that caffeine's effect on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits,too,reducing the risk of diseases,like Parkinson’s，Alzheimer‘s，and some types of cancer.

Caffeine can also ramp up the body's ability to burn fat.In fact,some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption.From 1972 until 2004,Olympic athletes had to stay below a certain blood- caffeine concentration to compete.Of course,not all of caffeine's effects are so helpful.It might make you feel better and more alert,but it can also raise your heart rate and blood pressure,cause increased urination or diarrhea,and contribute to insomnia and anxiety.

Plus,the foods and beverages caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body that have to be taken into account.Your brain can adapt to regular consumption of caffeine.If your adenosine receptors are perpetually clogged,your body will manufacture extra ones.That way,even with caffeine around,adenosine can still do its job of signaling the brain to power down.That's why you may find you need to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert.

There are more and more adenosine repceptors to block.It's also why if you suddenly quit caffeine,you may experience an unpleasant withdrawal.With plenty of receptors and no competition,adenosine can work overtime,causing symptoms like headaches,tiredness,and depressed moods.But in the few days,the extra adenosine recpetors will disappear,your body will readjust,and you'll feel just as alert as ever,even without an infusion of the world's most popular stimulant.
